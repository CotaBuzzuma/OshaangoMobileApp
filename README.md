# OshaangoMobileApp
With the fast spreading of diseases country wide, I propose to come up with the solution to eradication of escalating disease (SEED) web based/mobile application to contribute to the solution of eradicating diseases. This system will have 3 section: emergency section, Ministry of Health and Social Services information to public section and HIV/ TB Patients medication distribution monitoring and report section. About Emergency section when a certain individual experience or witness certain conditions he/she just need to go to the application and notify the nearby hospital by clicking at the appropriate section for the hospital to take the necessary course by sending the ambulance. On Ministry of Health and Social Services information to public about deadly diseases section in case of any information the ministry would like to share with the public all they do is update it on the page and the public is well aware of what exactly is happening in the country. HIV/ TB Patients medication distribution monitoring and report section for them to be notified when to collect their medicine. This application will be able to be installed in all devices and will have a button for all languages spoken in the world for a certain user to use the language they understand. At the backend of SEED application will be able to keep the patientsâ€™ history and once the name entered in, it should be able to provide the history of the patients if he/she ever visited a hospital before and all other diseases ever diagnosed on.
